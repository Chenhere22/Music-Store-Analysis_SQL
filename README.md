**SQL Project: Music Store Analysis

This project demonstrates how to analyze an online music store database using SQL, specifically using Snowflake SQL. The aim is to help the store understand its business performance by answering key business questions through SQL queries. This project is beginner-friendly and offers a practical approach to learning relational databases and performing data analysis using Snowflake SQL.

Overview
In this project, you will be analyzing a music playlist database that contains information about customers, invoices, tracks, albums, artists, and genres. Using SQL, you will derive insights that help the business understand customer behavior, track popularity, sales patterns, and other key metrics that support decision-making.

Database and Tools
Database: Snowflake SQL
SQL Client: PgAdmin4 (Snowflake SQL-compatible client)
Schema: Music Store Database
Database Schema
The Music Store Database contains the following key tables:

Customer: Contains customer information, including location details.
Invoice: Tracks details of each transaction, including the total amount.
InvoiceLine: Represents the items purchased in each invoice, linked to individual tracks.
Track: Information about each track, including genre, album, and pricing.
Album: Each album contains multiple tracks and is associated with an artist.
Artist: Details of the artists who have albums in the store.
Genre: The categorization of tracks into different genres.


Project Objectives
To practice SQL querying using Snowflake.
To explore relationships between the different tables in the music store database.
To derive insights on business performance, customer preferences, sales trends, and popular genres.
Key Business Questions
Top Customers by Country:

Identify the top customers based on their total spending in each country.
Most Popular Genres by Country:

Determine the most popular music genre in each country based on the number of purchases.
Total Sales by Country:

Calculate the total sales per country to analyze which regions generate the most revenue.
Best-Selling Artists:

Identify the artists with the highest number of tracks sold.
Top-Selling Tracks:

Find the tracks that generate the highest revenue.
Customer Retention Patterns:

Analyze purchase patterns to assess how many customers make repeat purchases.

Tools Used
Snowflake SQL: A cloud-based data platform that allows for easy and scalable querying.
PgAdmin4: A graphical database management tool used to interact with databases like Snowflake via an SQL client.
How to Run the Project
Set Up Snowflake SQL: Sign up for a Snowflake account or use an existing one.
Connect SQL Client (PgAdmin4): Use PgAdmin4 or another SQL client compatible with Snowflake to interact with the database.
Load the Schema: Import the provided Music Store Database schema into Snowflake.
Run Queries: Execute the example SQL queries or write your own to answer the business questions.
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this project, you will have learned how to:

Write complex SQL queries using Snowflake SQL.
Use SQL window functions like ROW_NUMBER() and PARTITION BY.
Query and analyze relational databases.
Understand key business metrics such as customer retention, sales trends, and product popularity.
